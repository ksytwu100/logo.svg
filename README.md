# logo.svg


## Description

This project is a scalable application of object-oriented programming.  Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a two-dimensional graphics vector image format based on XML. The application takes responsive user input to select a shape, shape color, and provide text and then the SVG logo is dynamically generated. 
The students learn how to use constructor functions to create new objects and new instances, add methods to objects using prototype inheritance, write jest tests in the test-driven development, implement promise .then() method, and call back function in the application. 


## Usage 

The concept can be expanded to make other types of graphics for businesses and institutions.
